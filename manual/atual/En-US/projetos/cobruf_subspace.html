              Team Earth's first project was called EUROPA DIVER in which a conceptual design of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for space exploration was developed. Whose vehicle's objective was to be able to land on the moon Europa of the planet Jupiter, and after piercing the surface ice layer, collect samples from the seas, perform analyzes and send the results to a land station on the moon's surface, similar to the mission that NASA has been developing and intends to run in 2025. 
            </p>
            <p class="description justificadotexto">
              The designed AUV-TERRA is capable of operating in cold oceans up to 400 m deep. Able to collect liquid and solid samples and perform astrobiological and astrogeological analysis of the samples, recognizing some components of the explored environment. In addition, the entire structure is designed to withstand certain levels of vibration, pressure, temperature and other conditions that the harsh environment can bring. It is a viable structure for construction and its system is modular, allowing for new evolutions in the future, through replacements with new versions or adding new modules.
            </p>
            <p class="description justificadotexto">
              Its design was inspired by the AUV - Artemis, has four thrusters, providing maneuvers with four degrees of freedom and a hydrodynamic and efficient structure. The project has a safety factor in case there is any problem with its batteries and/or communication with the station.

                  For data collection and analysis, the sample collection system developed by MBARI (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute) for the Dorado AUV was used as inspiration. The vehicle uses the suction mechanism to perform the collection, so when the submerged vehicle encounters a solid object during the mission, it will move smoothly towards the obstacle until it makes contact with it, when this happens the AUV turns on the mini compressor vacuum tube that is located at the front of the vehicle along with a channel that takes the sample to an internal compartment, where the samples will be contained and analyzed by the Raman spectrometer. In addition, the AUV-TERRA has several external sensors to assist in collecting data about the environment to be explored.

                <p class="description justificadotexto">
                  Communication between the ground station and the AUV occurs acoustically by ultrasound, due to the good propagation in the underwater environment. And for the control part, the logic of the hybrid system was used, with characteristics of deliberative and reactive layers, identifying three main modules:

              The navigation system used by AUV - TERRA is dual and independent. It utilizes Dead Reckoning and SLAM systems for its estimated location and environment mapping. The data collected by the sensors contains noise, that's why we use the Particle Filter to bring the most real result of the analysis done.

              The ground station was also designed, capable of receiving and storing the data collected and analyzed by the underwater vehicle.

Its legs can be used between 0 and 90 degrees.

              The ideal landing gear for Europa Diver should ensure a smooth and stable landing in the region chosen for the mission equipment, including: AUV, ground station and drilling system. Therefore, a study was carried out to decide the best way to land the components and identify the ideal place for the insertion of the autonomous vehicle in the ocean, so we chose to use the SkyCrane system to perform the landing.
            </p>
            <p class="justificado">
              The landing site was chosen after studies of missions to be carried out in the coming years. Analyzing possible missions, it was seen that the Europa Clipper mission aims to orbit Jupiter in order to study some of its moons, especially Europa, and determine the thickness of the ice sheet, depth and salinity. It was also seen that the Europa Lander mission, a complementary mission to the Europa Clipper mission, will land in Europe to collect surface data. As the objective of the Europa Diver mission is to drill through the ice surface and then make the AUV access the water, smaller thicknesses are of greater interest. With that in mind, data collected in the future by Lander and Clipper will be used to find the best landing site.
            </p>
            <p class="justificado">
              Due to the ice sheet that covers Europe's ocean, a drilling system is required to insert the projected AUV into the environment. In today's scientific landscape, crybots, space exploration drilling robots capable of melting and traversing several meters of ice, are being developed. Among these technologies is IceMole, a drill developed by the astronautical laboratory of the University of Applied Sciences in Aachen, Germany. Positioned in the drill channel, the IceMole will serve as the AUV's data receiver to relay to the base via communication cables.

            The Europa Diver mission will operate in conjunction with an orbiter that will be sent to explore and analyze the Europa lunar environment, obtaining information about its geological and biological structures, if any. The option to operate in conjunction with an orbiter is more suitable for Europa Diver as it facilitates the sending of information that the AUV collects to Earth, as the AUV has the necessary instruments to collect information that the probes are not able to obtain.
          </p>
          <p class="description justificadotexto">
            When inserted in the mission environment, the AUV-TERRA will behave randomly in the search for samples, prioritizing the prevention of collisions in the environment and with the active lighting system and camera turned on to generate images in real time. Spectroscopy instruments and mechanical waves will constantly be capturing environmental information during the mission, and if the vehicle finds any sample with a known biosignature or geological structure in the environment, it will store the information.
          </p>
          <p class="description justificadotexto">
            At the end of the mission, the vehicle will send the data obtained to the tunneling machine, which upon receiving the information will pass through an ethernet communication cable to the base, which will send it to the orbiter by electromagnetic waves and then the information will be redirected to planet Earth. The main information that is sought during the mission are: seismic activities and lunar behavior, information obtained by the seismograph, capturing the mechanical waves around it, geological chemical composition of the moon, obtained by analyzing an astrogeological sample of the moon using the Raman spectrometer and verify the existence of life by analyzing environmental biosignatures, information that will be obtained by analyzing environmental samples with the Raman spectroscopy technique.
