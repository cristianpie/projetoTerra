              In 2021, the TERRA Team performs its first participation in Robosub representing the Federal University of Santa Catarina - Campus Joinville. AUVille is the AUV developed by the team for this edition of the competition, below are the main points developed in this project.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title">Structure</h3>
            <p class="description justificado">
              For the design of the AUVille the team decided continue with the design of the BlueROV2 by the American company BlueRobotics, which is the equipment that the team physically has in its laboratory (Naval Simulation Laboratory - LaSiN), because new solutions developed during the project may in the future be tested experimentally and actually implemented.
            </p>
            <p class="description justificadotexto">
              In this way, the team improved the initial design of the ROV, incorporating another frame and watertight enclosure, to allow the allocation of more batteries, thrusters and new components should the need arise in the future. It is noteworthy that the frame and additional watertight enclosure are made of the same material as the original ROV components, which are high density polyethylene (HDPE) and cast acrylic, respectively. These materials were selected because they have good physical properties, HDPE has resistance to high stresses and low density when compared to other materials, while cast acrylic has excellent resistance to mechanical stress and good thermal stability.

              Therefore, the structural part of the vehicle with all its electronic components and thrusters is about 15 kg and the total weight of the batteries proposed for this project is 2.11 kg thus resulting in a final weight of 17.11 kg for the complete AUVille set. The modeling of the complete structure carried out in the ANSYS software can be seen in the figure in side:

            <p class="description justificado">
              The structural simulation were performed using ANSYS software to determine internal and external forces and the corresponding stresses, as well as the determination of displacements and corresponding deformations of the designed structure, so that with the obtained results, it was possible to understand if the structure would resist to all tensions that would act throughout the mission.

            <p class="description justificado">
              Regarding the AUVille propulsion system, the team chose to maintain the commercial configuration of the BlueROV2 equipment, due to the impossibility of performing tests in water to validate the new configuration. Thus, four horizontal thrusters angled at 45º and two vertical thrusters were maintained, with this vehicle has the ability to move in surge, heave, pitch and yaw directions.
            </p>
            <h3 class="">Hydrodynamic simulation</h3>
            <p class="description justificado">
              The behavior of fluids is not very intuitive, making it very difficult to predict its impact on projects. It is very common to conduct tests in water to understand the behavior of the vehicle in operation. However, due to the impossibility of conducting experimental tests, the team also used ANSYS software to simulate the flow behavior and analyze the obtained results.
            </p>
            <p class="description justificadotexto">
              As a result of the conducted simulations, it was possible to understand the speed, pressure and drag force on the AUV hull, from this result, the selection of the correct power supply voltage of the thrusters were possible and thus selected the battery configuration most suitable for the project.

              The main challenge system was to propose a solution that would allow the vehicle to have a good autonomy without compromising the performance of the electrical components and in order to add as little weight as possible to the structure. To assist in choosing the solution, members of this sector carried out a survey of the vehicle components that consume the most energy in the system, namely the thrusters and electronic components: Raspberry, Pixhawk and ESCs. 
            </p>        
          </div> 
          <div class="col-md-5 ml-auto mr-auto text-center">
            <p class="justificado">
              Next, the specifics of each of them were analyzed and it was noted that the electronic components in general work at a lower voltage than the thrusters, so it was decided to divide the power system into two circuits, one to power the thrusters and the other to power the watertight enclosure that houses the electronic components, because that way it would be possible to find an ideal battery solution for each of these circuits and it would not be necessary to use a component to reduce the voltage that feeds the electronic components. With this, it was also established that the batteries would be placed in the vehicle in different enclosures, with the upper one for powering the electronic components and the lower one for the thrusters.

            <h3 class="">Battery selection</h3>
            <p class="justificado">
              From the results found in the hydrodynamic simulation, it was possible to identify the voltage required to power the thrusters so that the drag force was overcome and the AUVille could navigate with an appropriate speed during the mission. Thus, for each speed simulated in the previous item, the vehicle's autonomy was determined. From the analysis it was possible to observe that the maximum speed of the vehicle would be 3 knots and that the ideal operational speed would be 2 knots.
            </p>
            <p class="justificado">
              In order for the team available to carry out the mission until the battery was fully discharged, the team configured two lithium-ion batteries chemically composed of NCA (nickel, cobalt and aluminum) with the aim of meeting all the project's requirements.
            </p>
            <p class="justificado">
              From this, it has been established that the battery that will supply energy to the six thrusters must be composed of five cells in series and six in parallel (5S6P) and will be able to supply 18V to the thrusters for approximately 59.1 minutes. The battery that will power the electronics watertight enclosure will be composed of two cells in series and seven in parallel (2S7P) enabling the supply of 7.2 V to the electronic components with the same autonomy as the other battery.
            </p>
            <p class="justificado">
              This solution founded by the team met all the requirements and restrictions of this current project, providing a good autonomy without impacting the vehicle's performance with respect to its operating speed and structural weight.

          <h3 class="title text-center">Cooling system</h3>
          <p class="description justificado">
            Currently, a major challenge faced in electronic systems is the heating of their components due to the increase in the intensity of electrical current resulting from the implementation of new functions and the simultaneous operation of subsystems. Applying this context to the BlueROV2 operated by the team, converting it to an AUV required the development of a new cooling device for the installed Raspberry processing unit, as its overheating at temperatures above 65°C implied a critical reduction in the autonomy of the vehicle, preventing the performance of the designated activities, as well as reducing the useful life of the component due to the thermal work cycle to which it was submitted.
          </p>
          <p class="description justificadotexto">
            In face of such problems, an analysis of the initial watertight enclosure dissipation capacity and the survey of the unfavorable cooling characteristics of the system were carried out. In which it was observed that the thermal exchange was performed via free convection with the air inside the watertight enclosure. The low thermal conductivity of the air and the polymeric walls of the watertight enclosure, together with the inefficiency of free convection in heat exchange, imply a high thermal resistance between the electronic components and the external environment. Thus, it was essential for the effectiveness of the project that this resistance be reduced.
          </p>
          <p class="description ">Based on this, some constraints and selection criteria were listed, as follows:
          <ol class="lista">
            <li>Difficulty in repositioning components and spatial restriction;</li> 
            <li> Preservation of structural integrity and tightness of the watertight enclosure; </li>

            Based on the project constraints and through the discussed discarded solutions, the team defined the final characteristics of the thermal control device to be implemented in the AUV, which it was concluded that a conductive base will be mounted on the Raspberry processor, adhered via thermal paste. From this base, the heat produced will be conducted by a heat pipe to the heatsink, a conductive component installed through the watertight housing wall. The coupling of the heat pipe to the heatsink will also be done through a conductive base. The interface of this assembly will be filled with a thermal epoxy adhesive. Observing the low thermal conductivity of this adhesive in relation to the metallic materials of the set, the dimensional adjustment of the coupling will be such that, while still guaranteeing adhesion, it will minimize the thermal resistance at the interface.
          </p>
          <p class="description justificadotexto">
            In order to avoid heat transfer via internal natural convection by air in the vicinity of the components, the entire surface of the assembly (bases, heat pipe and heatsink) exposed to the internal air will be enclosed by an insulating film. Recalling the discussion made in restriction 2, the effectiveness and efficiency of the device are linked to the proportion of heat conducted through the set in relation to that transferred to the air inside the watertight enclosure.
          </p>
          <p class="description justificadotexto">
            Since the heatsink will be mounted through the wall of the structure, there is a concern with stress concentration and tightness after installation. The solution found by the team consists of machining a single circular hole in the wall, avoiding geometries with sharp edges and installing the heatsink by treating the surface of the interface with a primer and applying a polymeric sealant, similar to that used in the automotive industry in the adhesion of glass to metallic components.

          <p class="description justificadotexto">
            In order to build the code for the AUVille, the team used ROS (Robot Operating System) using GitHub?s repository as a base. The first modification was to make it autonomous since the original code was for ROVs. The communication was established through a connection emulator code using the MAVROS protocols and pymavlink once more, making the execution commands come from the image recognition and no longer from an external connection. This avoided having to create a specialized code (or an AI) for the decision-making during the mission, providing a time-saver to refine the control code.

            The computer vision tool chosen to be used in the project was the OpenCV library with the code implementation being done in Python. The code implemented through OpenCV uses the library standard methods to detect the competition?s portal, a qualifying task in this competition. It operates by tracking down the vertical bars found on the portal and determining their coordinates. This detection is done using OpenCV?s morphological operations, which spot the vertical and horizontal lines in images. So, after the identification of the central coordinate of the gate, the system also identifies the center coordinates of the chosen character, that in this case was a police officer. In the flowchart, you can better understand how these steps were programmed into the team's image processing code.
          </p>  
          <p class="description justificadotexto">
            After providing the coordinates of the portal and of the police officer in the image, this data can be sent to the AUV?s control code that will activate the thrusters according to the direction the vehicle should follow to pass through the gate by the previously selected side.

            The AUVille?s project also included a module to collect all the data from the AUV?s sensors individually (barometer, gyroscope, velocity, compass, energy consumption, motors and camera status) and separate them into txt files. This will allow the team to plot graphs using the extracted data to study and evaluate the system?s performance. Lastly, from the analysis of the collected information, new solutions and improvements could be suggested in the future to further optimize the vehicle?s performance.

          <p class="description justificado">
            Because the AUV is a vehicle that during the mission must do its tasks autonomously, it is necessary to implement a safety system in case of some unanticipated, that was not considered in the pre-programing stage, occurs. Therefore, the team created a code and modeled a shutdown button that once pressed will turn off the thrusters, so that the vehicle enters a safe mode for its retrieval and does not put at risk the diver who approaches to perform the rescue.

          <p class="description justificado">
            The modeling of the button was done using SolidWorks software. A simple and easy design was sought, but with sturdy and reliable components in order to ensure that the button actioning can be done in a fast and safe way. Meanwhile the code was developed in order to deactivate the thrusters by cutting the power to these components as soon as the button is pressed. In this way, the propulsive system should remain deactivated until the vehicle is rescued and the diver is allowed to press the button again to continue the mission.

            Detailing the operation of the shutdown button, initially, as soon as it is pressed, the system is put into safe mode. In this way, AUVille suspends the execution of the mission and turns off the thrusters. At this point, the AUV was also programmed to flash its four LEDs, equipped according to the standard S.O.S. signaling, to indicate to the rescuer that it is safe to approach and handle the equipment. Lastly, if the button is pressed again while in suspended mode, the system will resume normal operation and will signal this by fully lighting the LEDs.
